# Cloud Native Buildpacks Specification v3

This specification defines interactions between a platform, a lifecycle, a number of buildpacks, and an application
1. For the purpose of transforming that application into an OCI image and
2. For the purpose of developing or executing automated tests on that application.

A **buildpack** is software that partially or completely transforms application source code into runnable artifacts.

A **lifecycle** is software that orchestrates buildpacks and transforms the resulting artifacts into an OCI image.

A **platform** is software that orchestrates a lifecycle to make buildpack functionality available to end-users such as application developers.
